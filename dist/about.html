          <p>
            I'm currently a dedicated student at the University of Florida,
            working towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a
            minor in Entrepreneurship. My true passion lies in software
            engineering. I'm all about those lines of code and turning complex
            challenges into elegant solutions. The realm of Artificial
            Intelligence and Machine Learning really speaks to me. The idea of
            shaping the future through code is what keeps me motivated. But I'm
            not just about coding – I'm all about experiences too. I thrive on
            new adventures and soaking up everything life has to offer.
            Traveling is a big part of that for me. My dream is to explore the
            world, immerse myself in different cultures, and savor every moment.
            When I'm not coding or dreaming of travel, you'll find me in the gym
            or playing sports. Staying active is essential, and I've recently
            discovered the thrill of pickleball. It's a sport that perfectly
            mirrors my approach to challenges – strategic, fast-paced, and full
            of determination. My friendly and approachable nature makes me a
            great team player. I love collaborating with like-minded individuals
            who share my goal of making a positive impact on the world.
            Challenges don't scare me; they inspire me to push harder and grow
            stronger. Thanks for joining me on this journey. My work experiences
            are right below, showcasing my dedication and hard work.

          <h6>Externship</h6>
          <p>
            I led a team in developing a strategic venture plan that addressed
            strengths and weaknesses through actionable strategies. I also
            authored a Social Media marketing handbook optimizing platform
            features for ad campaigns and directed the production of a 2-minute
            venture video, overseeing scripting, editing, and message delivery
            optimization. I presented project outcomes to community leaders and
            local entrepreneurs, resulting in recognition with the "Here and
            Now" award for immediate company impact.

          <h6>Front Desk</h6>
          <p>
            In my role, I had the opportunity to take charge of foot traffic
            flow at the gym, ensuring that 400 daily members experienced a
            smooth and satisfying visit. It was rewarding to witness increased
            member satisfaction as a result of these optimizations.
            Additionally, I had the privilege of excelling in merchandise sales,
            ranking first in two out of three months and consistently placing
            among the top three in premium membership sales. While supporting
            inventory management, I efficiently managed supplies, received
            equipment deliveries, and worked closely with the manager to ensure
            their streamlined utilization. As a testament to my commitment, I
            was entrusted with weekend assistant manager responsibilities,
            contributing to a productive and customer-friendly environment.

          <h3>Regal Cabinate Designer</h3>
          <h6>Administrative Assitant</h6>
          <p>
            In my role, I took on the responsibility of managing 20-30 client
            appointments each week, ensuring meticulous record-keeping and
            smooth communication. Additionally, I played a key role in the daily
            management of inventory, promptly placing orders for essential
            materials, equipment, and supplies. To further enhance our customer
            service, I implemented efficient payment plans that contributed to
            our team's reputation for excellence. Furthermore, I actively
            participated in installations and loading stations, strategically
            optimizing job timelines and overall efficiency. It was a pleasure
            to be part of a team that consistently delivered exceptional results
            while maintaining a casual yet professional atmosphere.
