            As an individual with a relentless drive to better myself, I have
            discovered a true passion for becoming a full-time, full-stack
            developer. This passion has been fueled by my exceptional
            understanding of logic and problem-solving, combined with my strong
            background in mathematics. Despite my relatively short time in this
            field, I stand out due to my unwavering dedication to learning and
            insatiable curiosity for new knowledge. While my primary focus is on
            honing my coding and algorithm skills, I also enjoy staying active
            outside of work. Whether I'm hitting the gym or the basketball
            court, or simply unwinding with a video game, I firmly believe that
            a healthy work-life balance is essential to achieving success in all
            areas of life. If you're interested in learning more about my
            experience and qualifications, please take a moment to explore the
            tabs on this website. I am confident that my hard work and
            dedication will be evident in everything you see

            As a former lead salesperson at Planet Fitness, I gained valuable
            experience in customer service, sales, and team collaboration while
            working at the front desk, managing inventory, and selling
            memberships. While this may seem like a simple job, it taught me the
            importance of being part of a team and creating a positive work
            environment. During my time at Planet Fitness, I worked hard to
            promote a family-like atmosphere, where everyone felt welcome and
            supported. This required me to develop strong communication skills
            and learn how to diffuse difficult situations with ease. These
            skills have proven to be invaluable throughout my life, and have
            helped me to navigate a variety of challenging situations with
            confidence and professionalism. In addition to my work at the front
            desk, Planet Fitness also provided me with a unique opportunity to
            improve my personal fitness journey. By being surrounded by others
            who were committed to bettering themselves, I found the motivation
            to push myself further and achieve my own fitness goals. This
            experience taught me the importance of setting goals and staying
            motivated, both in my personal and professional life. Overall, my
            time at Planet Fitness was a formative experience that taught me
            valuable lessons in teamwork, communication, and personal growth.
