          <p>
            I'm currently a dedicated student at the University of Florida,
            working towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a
            minor in Entrepreneurship. My true passion lies in software
            engineering. I'm all about those lines of code and turning complex
            challenges into elegant solutions. The realm of Artificial
            Intelligence and Machine Learning really speaks to me. The idea of
            shaping the future through code is what keeps me motivated. But I'm
            not just about coding – I'm all about experiences too. I thrive on
            new adventures and soaking up everything life has to offer.
            Traveling is a big part of that for me. My dream is to explore the
            world, immerse myself in different cultures, and savor every moment.
            When I'm not coding or dreaming of travel, you'll find me in the gym
            or playing sports. Staying active is essential, and I've recently
            discovered the thrill of pickleball. It's a sport that perfectly
            mirrors my approach to challenges – strategic, fast-paced, and full
            of determination. My friendly and approachable nature makes me a
            great team player. I love collaborating with like-minded individuals
            who share my goal of making a positive impact on the world.
            Challenges don't scare me; they inspire me to push harder and grow
            stronger. Thanks for joining me on this journey. My work experiences
            are right below, showcasing my dedication and hard work.

            In my role, I collaborated closely with the development team to
            overhaul the FERN stack UI, leading to a significant enhancement in
            the user interface. I also played a pivotal role in improving the UI
            search prompt, enabling it to handle multiple image descriptions
            seamlessly and integrating a style component to support various AI
            image generation styles. Additionally, I designed and implemented an
            efficient system for AI generative descriptions, further enhancing
            the overall efficiency of the application.
